# Gesture Based Brightness Control Using Hand Tracking

**Project Overview:**

The Gesture-Based Brightness Control project is an innovative application of computer vision and gesture recognition, enabling users to adjust the screen brightness in real-time without physical contact. By using hand tracking techniques, specifically the movement of the index and thumb fingers, this system allows users to control brightness based on the distance between these two fingers.

**Key Features:**

Real-Time Hand Tracking: Utilizing MediaPipe's hand-tracking capabilities, the system tracks the user's hand landmarks, focusing on the tips of the index and thumb fingers. This tracking occurs in real-time, providing immediate visual feedback for brightness control.

Gesture-Based Control: The brightness adjustment is based on the distance between the index and thumb fingers. As the user brings these fingers closer together, the brightness decreases; when they move further apart, the brightness increases. This provides an intuitive, touchless control method.

Smooth Brightness Transition: The distance between the fingers is mapped to a brightness scale that allows smooth transitions between low and high brightness levels. This dynamic control ensures the system is responsive and visually smooth.

On-Screen Visual Feedback: To enhance user interaction, the system provides visual feedback by displaying the brightness value on the screen and showing a line connecting the index and thumb, indicating the distance being used for control.

**Technologies Used:**


Python: The core programming language used to develop the project.
OpenCV: Used for video capture, image processing, and brightness adjustment.
MediaPipe: A powerful framework used for real-time hand tracking and landmark detection.


**How It Works:**


Hand Detection: The system starts by detecting the user's hand using the webcam feed, identifying key landmarks on the hand (such as the tips of the fingers) with the help of MediaPipe's hand module.

Brightness Calculation: The distance between the tips of the thumb and index finger is calculated using simple geometric distance formulas. This distance is then mapped to a brightness scale, controlling the screen's brightness dynamically.

Brightness Adjustment: Using the calculated distance, the system modifies the brightness of the video feed in real-time, allowing users to adjust it smoothly by altering their finger positions.

**Applications:**

Touchless Control Systems: This project demonstrates how gesture-based controls can be implemented in various systems such as mobile phones, laptops, or even large display screens.
User Interface Innovation: The project highlights the future potential of touchless interactions, particularly in environments where touchscreens are not feasible or desired.
Assistive Technology: Gesture-based control can be used in accessibility tools for people with limited mobility, allowing them to interact with devices without physical contact.


**Future Enhancements:**

Implementing more gestures for controlling other screen elements (e.g., volume control).

Enhancing the system to work in various lighting conditions.

Expanding it to multiple gestures and functions for different user preferences.

This project is an exciting example of how computer vision, real-time hand tracking, and gesture recognition can create intuitive, touchless interfaces, making interactions with digital devices more seamless and accessible.
